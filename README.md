### Known bugs
* For some reason I can't view user profiles in the Heroku app eventhough it works in the workspace. The Admin profile seems to work fine.

# Agile Workflow
An approximation of the agile workflow was implemented in the development of this project. The key ideas adopted were:

* **Prioritize essential features:** I focused on the implementation of fundamental features that were the most important for the project's core functionality.

* **Work in small Iterations:** The project was divided into manageable iterations, lasting one week. Each iteration was to deliver a functional portion of the project.

* **Add Additional Features When Possible:** After completing the most important features, I focused on adding more functions and a better user experience.

## GitHub

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...
1. From this [GitHub template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template)
2. Find the "Use this template" and click "Create a new repository"
3. Give it a name and a pick private or public. Click "Create repository from template"
4. When created click the Github button.
<br>
<br>

## Forking

To create a copy of an existing GitHub repository without affecting the original, we can fork the repository using these steps:
1. Log in to your [GitHub](https://github.com/) account and navigate to the repository you want to fork.
2. Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account that you can view and make changes to without affecting the original.
<br>
<br>

## Clone
Here are the steps to clone a GitHub repository:
1. Log in to your [GitHub](https://github.com/) account and locate the repository you want to clone.
2. Click the "Clone" button.
3. Copy the HTTPS link shown under "Clone with HTTPS".
4. Open Git Bash or another command-line interface.
5. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the cloned repository.
6. Type git clone and paste the URL you copied in Step 3. The command should look like this: git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.
7. Press Enter to run the command.
8. Wait for the cloning process to complete. A message like the following should appear in the console:

```
    $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
    > Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
    > remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
    > remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
    > remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
    > Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
```

## Push
1. Navigate to your local Git repository on your computer using your terminal or command prompt.
2. Make sure you are on the correct branch by running the command: `git branch`. If you're not on the correct branch, you can switch to it using: `git checkout <"branch-name">`.
3. Next, add the changes you have made to the file to the Git staging area using the command: `git add <"filename">`, or `git add .` to commit all files. This will prepare the changes for committing.
4. Commit the changes to the repository using the command: `git commit -m "Commit message"`.
5. Push the changes to the remote repository using the command: `git push`. This will update the file on the remote repository, making your changes available to others.

## Django Creation

* Install libraries and Django according to the walkthrough on Code Institute.
```
$ pip3 install 'django<4' gunicorn
$ pip3 install dj_database_url psycopg2
$ pip3 install dj3-cloudinary-storage
$ pip3 install django-crispy-forms  
$ pip3 install crispy-bootstrap5
```
* Created requirements.txt
```
$ pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
```
* Create Django project
```
$ django-admin startproject reciperepublic .
```
* Created my recipe app and then added it in **settings.py**

```
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'cloudinary_storage',  # Cloudinary Storage
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',

    # All Auth
    'allauth',
    'allauth.account',
    'allauth.socialaccount',

    # My Apps
    'cloudinary',
    'recipe',
    'profiles',

    # Other
    'crispy_forms',
    'crispy_bootstrap5',
    'djrichtextfield'
]
```

* Add Cripy forms to **settings.py**
```
CRISPY_ALLOWED_TEMPLATE_PACKS = 'bootstrap5'
CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK = 'bootstrap5'
```

## ElephantSQL Account Setup
* Create account with Github
* Click Create New Instance
* Choose TinyTurtle Plan
* Enter project name
* Pick region
* From dashboard. Click the project
* Copy URL and paste to **env.py**
* Inside **settings.py** add this:

```
import os
import dj_database_url
if os.path.isfile('env.py'):
  import env
```
In **settings.py** add enviroment variables:
```
DATABASES = {
    'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
 }
```
Migrate changes:
```
$ python manage.py makemigrations
$ python manage.py migrate
```

## Cloudinary Setup
* Create Cloudinary account
* From the dashboard, copy the URL
* Paste it inside the **env.py**:
```
    import os

os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = the databse URL from ElephantSQL
os.environ["SECRET_KEY"]= a string used to generate security keys
os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"] = The url for Cloudinary storage
```
* Then copy the URL to the Heroku Config Vars
* Also add a temporary called DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC and set it to "0"
* Add Cloudinary to installed app inside **settings.py**

```
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'cloudinary_storage',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',

    # My Apps
    'cloudinary',

```
* Then tell Django to use Cloudinary for our static files by adding this in **settings.py**
```
STATIC_URL = '/static/'

# Cloudinary Settings
STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.StaticHashedCloudinaryStorage'
STATICFILES_DIRS = (os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static'),)
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')

MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'
```



## Heroku Deployment

* Created a app called 'recipe-republic'.

* Add Procfile to project root directory

* Added these config vars:
    * CLOUDINARY_URL
    * DATABASE_URL
    * DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC
    * HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_GRAY_URL
    * SECRET_KEY

* Before final deployment, the debug setting in settings.py was set from **TRUE** to **FALSE** for security.
    * Due to some Heroku problems I had to do it like this:
        * **DEBUG = 'DEVELOPMENT' in os.environ**
            * And added this inside my env.py:<br>**os.environ["DEVELOPMENT"] = "1"**<br>(And commit it out before deployment.)

* Before the final deployment, the DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC config var in Heroku was changed from 1 to 0
* Connect to Github repository
    * Deploy from branch
    * Select GitHub branch
    * Click deploy button
